            I am a Responsive Designer & Developer who thrives on visual storytelling.
             When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole 
             of blogs & books, I can be found traveling, hiking and searching for new stories.

               <p>Stan Lee is the greatest of all time
                   Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care 
                   about! Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own 
                   mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. There's only one man I've ever called a 
                    coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. 
                    No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's 
                    questions because I am an honest man with no secrets.</p>

                <p>Dad didn't leaveâ€¦ When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right 
                    in your face! Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. 
                    Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son.Oh yes I will
                    survive this quest..
